# This is a list of NRGLAB's events

# Each event may have the following fields:

# cover_img    {string} Absolute path to the cover image
# end_time     {date}   When does the event end?
# fb_event_id  {int}    The Facebook event ID as shown in the URL
# name         {string} Name of the event
# publish_time {date}   When should the event be allowed to appear publicly on the site?
# start_time   {date}   When does the event begin?
# start_text   {string} Text that may be used in place of the start time, e.g. "Hallowe'en 2022"
# venue        {string} Name of the venue

# Generally no field is mandatory.
# If a field is ommitted, the layout will either omit or substitute the data.
# For instance, the website's event list shows "TBA" if a venue hasn't been provided.

# The spotlight partial will take the first event from this list that:
#  - Has a start_time in the future
#  - Has a publish_time in the past
